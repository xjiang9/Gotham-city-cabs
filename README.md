# Gotham-city-cabs
It is around the year 2034 in the city of Gotham, and the last time Batman got into a fight with the Joker, the Batmobile (Batman's high-tech car) was seriously damaged. Apparently, it would take his butler, Alfred, a while to fix the car and during that time Batman needs to use a cab to save people!

Alfred needs your help to come up with a good prediction of the taxi trip duration between multiple points of the Gotham city. If he can make such predictions, then that significantly helps with Batman's missions.

Lucius (Batman's tech support sta) has been able to pull out a rich dataset of the recorded taxi durations between various parts of the city and is sharing that with you for your modeling purposes.

The input features of the aforementioned data file are:

pickup datetime: a variable containing a date and a time specifying the date and thetime the taxi picked of a passenger. For instance, you may observe a pickup datetime of "6/14/2034 3:00:00 AM", which indicates the time the taxi picked up the passenger.Note that you may also obtain the day of the week, or the season information from this dataset. For instance, if we look up the 2034 calendar (search it on Google), you would see that \6/14/2034" is a Wednesday.

pickup x: This is a variable that represents the x coordinate of the location the taxi picked up the passenger.

pickup y: This is a variable that represents the y coordinate of the location the taxi picked up the passenger.


dropoff x: This is a variable that represents the x coordinate of the location the taxi dropped off the passenger.


dropoff y: This is a variable that represents the y coordinate of the location the taxidropped off the passenger.

The response variable is:

duration: which is the duration of the trip in seconds.

As a competitionï¼Œwe will compare the MSE of the test data. The winner is the one has the lowest MSE value. Good luck!
